When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: when you have collaborators, or what to protect your code from loss

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: In case there are changes in the remote that conflict with the local 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: branch is a new development pathway of a repo. use it to develope a new feature in isolation from master.
clone isva copy of a repo in cluding all available commits. used to add to an alreasy existing repo.
fork is a github-specific clone of another repo that automatically establishes a remote on github and pushes repo up. use to develop a repo that's on github. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: You can work out conflicts for when it's time to merge with master


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A: You could send code back and forth. Understanding the history of changes and controling the current version would be harder. But you wouldn't need to learn git.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
experimental changes in separate branches. takes more time to merge it in to master, but won't muck up a group's work
